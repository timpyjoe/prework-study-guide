# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to created an interactive website that can be used as a study guide for the content presented in the prework modules.
This website was built as means to learn introductory language and methods in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
This web app helps conglomerate notes taken from the prework modules into one clean space.
In the process of making this web app, I learned many fundamentals that will serve as the building blocks in my journey towards becoming a full-stack developer.

## Usage

To use this web application, simply navigate to the page. The notes taken over the course of the prework will be presented directly on the page. The notes for each topic is neatly organized into specified sections for easier readability. Users can open the DevTools console ('Ctrl' + 'Shift' + 'I' on Windows, 'Command' + 'Option' + 'I' on MacOS) to see a list of the topics covered in the prework, as well as a suggestion for which topic to study first!
